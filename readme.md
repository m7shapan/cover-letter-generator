To whom it may concern,

I recently came across your job posting for the Backend Engineer on LinkedIn and I am very excited 
to apply. After reading the job description and requirements and matching it with my own experiences, 
I am certain that I would be a valuable asset to your company.

You will find both my resume and my LinkedIn profile attached to this form. 
It would be great to hear back from you and talk with you in more detail.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
